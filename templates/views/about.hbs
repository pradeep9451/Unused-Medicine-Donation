    <h2>About Us – Unused Medicine Donation Platform:-</h2>
    <p>At Unused Medicine Donation, we believe that unused medicine can save lives. We collect medicine from people who no longer need it and give it to those who do. By doing this, we help people who cannot afford the medicine they need to stay healthy.</p>

    <h2>Who We Are:-</h2>
    <p>We are a group of people who want to make sure that no good medicine goes to waste. We help individuals, hospitals, and pharmacies donate their unused medicine safely so it can help others.</p>

    <h2>What We Do:-</h2>
    <p><strong>Collect Medicine Donations:</strong> We accept unopened, unused, and unexpired medicine from people and organizations. We make sure everything we receive is safe and ready to be donated.</p>

    <p><strong>Give Medicine to People in Need:</strong> After we collect the medicine, we pass it on to clinics, shelters, and healthcare centers that help people who can't afford it.</p>

    <p><strong>Reduce Waste and Help the Planet:</strong> By donating unused medicine, we not only help people but also reduce waste, keeping it out of the trash and helping the environment.</p>

    <h2>Why It Matters:-</h2>
    <p>Many people don’t have the money to buy the medicine they need to stay healthy. At the same time, a lot of perfectly good medicine gets thrown away. We want to stop this by connecting medicine donors with people who need it.</p>

    <p><strong>Save Lives:</strong> Donating unused medicine could save someone's life or improve their health.</p>

    <p><strong>Prevent Waste:</strong> We make sure good medicine doesn’t go to waste.</p>

    <p><strong>Help Communities:</strong> We provide medicine to low-income families and communities who need it most.</p>

    <h2>How You Can Help:-</h2>
    <p><strong>Donate Your Unused Medicine:</strong> If you have extra medicine that you don’t need and it’s still good, you can donate it to us and help someone in need.</p>

    <p><strong>Partner with Us:</strong> Hospitals, pharmacies, and companies can also give their extra medicine to us so that more people can get the help they need.</p>

    <p><strong>Support Our Mission:</strong> You can also help by donating money, volunteering, or telling others about our platform.</p>
